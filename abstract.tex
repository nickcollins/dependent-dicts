\begin{abstract}
Dictionaries (\emph{aka} maps) are a core tool in any programming environment, serving many purposes.
In proof assistants - where simplicity is important but performance isn't - a typical implementation
involves a list of key-value pairs. Although easy to define and reason about, this approach has the disadvantage that keys
can be duplicated, leading to the fact that many distinct lists represent the same semantic mapping.
This many-one relationship creates various difficulties when used in practice, such as when proving
contraction and exchange for a type-checking judgment.
I introduce \emph{Skip-Zip}, a novel list-of-pair approach that uses a variant of delta encoding for
the keys, in a way that ensures there is no key duplication within the list;
each distinct list is semantically valid and represents a distinct semantic mapping. This yields
contraction and exchange for free.
